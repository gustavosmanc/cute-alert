I created this JS library as an open-source project (for studying purposes) to provide beautiful alert box messages made with HTML, CSS and JS only. Feel free to contribute with a pull request or suggestions.


## Installation Instructions

- Clone this repository into your project's lib folder.
- Import both "style.css" and "cute-alert.js" into your code just like described on the image below:

## Docs

It's way too simple for you to import this lib into your code, all you have to do is call ```cuteAlert()``` and pass its arguments in object notation.

```buttonText``` is an optional parameter, by default it's set as "OK".

```type``` will define what kind of alert box will be shown.

```js
const btnSuccess = document.querySelector('.show-Success')
btnSuccess.addEventListener('click', () =>{
    cuteAlert({
        type: "success",
        title: "Success",
        message: "Success in life!!",
        img: "src/img/success.svg",
        buttonText: "OK",
        playSound: 'src/sound/success.mp3',
})
})
```

```js
const btnError = document.querySelector('.show-Error')
btnError.addEventListener('click', () =>{
    cuteAlert({
        type: "error",
        title: "Error",
        message: "Error in broeser",
        img: "src/img/error.svg",
        buttonText: "OK",
        playSound: 'src/sound/error.mp3',
})
})
```

```js
const btnInfo = document.querySelector('.show-Info')
btnInfo.addEventListener('click', () =>{
    cuteAlert({
        type: "info",
        title: "Info",
        message: "The world die",
        img: "src/img/info.svg",
        buttonText: "OK",
        playSound: 'src/sound/info.mp3',
        closeStyle: 'circle',
})
})
```

```js
const btnWarning = document.querySelector('.show-Warning')
btnWarning.addEventListener('click', () =>{
    cuteAlert({
        type: "warning",
        title: "Warning",
        message: "Death in minutes...",
        img: "src/img/warning.svg",
        buttonText: "OK",
        playSound: 'src/sound/warning.mp3',
})
})

```

```js
const btnQuestion = document.querySelector('.show-Question')
btnQuestion.addEventListener('click', () =>{
    cuteAlert({
        type: "question",
        title: "Contributors",
        message: "hello do you want to give the repository a star?",
        img: "src/img/question.svg",
        confirmText: "Conform",
        cancelText: 'Cancel',
        playSound: 'src/sound/Question.mp3',
})
})
```

```cuteAlert()```returns a Promise, so you can use ```then``` to execute an action after the alert box frame is closed.

As for the question alert box, you can choose what you want to do after any of the buttons is pressed with ```then``` aswell.

```confirmText``` and ```cancelText``` are both optional, by the default they are set as "Confirm" and "Cancel" respectively.

### Close button as a circle

If you wish to have the close button styled as a circle, you need to pass ```closeStyle: "circle"``` as an argument in ```cuteAlert()```.

### Toasts

It's even easier to use toasts, all you have to do is call ```cuteToast()``` and pass ```type```, ```message``` and ```timer```(in miliseconds) as its arguments.

It also returns a Promise, so you can use ```then``` to execute an action after the toast is closed or reaches its end by a timer.
