I created this JS library as an open-source project (for studying purposes) to provide beautiful alert box messages made with HTML, CSS, and JS only. Feel free to contribute with a pull request or suggestions.

### Alert Types and Toasts
This library provides different types of alert boxes, each serving a unique purpose:
- **Success Alert**: Indicates a successful operation.
- **Error Alert**: Informs the user of an error or failure.
- **Warning Alert**: Serves as a warning or caution to the user.
- **Question Alert**: Asks the user a question requiring acknowledgment or action.

**Toasts** are lightweight notifications designed to mimic the analogy of popping up like a toast. They are used to display brief, auto-expiring information to the user and are less intrusive than alert boxes.

### Alert Box
```buttonText``` is an optional parameter, by default it's set as "OK".
```type``` will define what kind of alert box will be shown.

```cuteAlert()``` returns a Promise, so you can use ```then``` to execute an action after the alert box frame is closed.

As for the question alert box, you can choose what you want to do after any of the buttons is pressed with ```then``` as well.
```confirmText``` and ```cancelText``` are both optional, by default they are set as "Confirm" and "Cancel" respectively.

### Close Button as a Circle
If you wish to have the close button styled as a circle, you need to pass ```closeStyle: "circle"``` as an argument in ```cuteAlert()```.

### Toasts

It's even easier to use toasts, all you have to do is call ```cuteToast()``` and pass ```type```, ```message```, and ```timer```(in milliseconds) as its arguments.

It also returns a Promise, so you can use ```then``` to execute an action after the toast is closed or reaches its end by a timer.
